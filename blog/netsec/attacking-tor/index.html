<h1>Attacking the TOR Network</h1>
<section>
    <p>Anonymity is not a recent concern. The desire to be able to speak or act without fear of repercussions has been
        one that has existed for thousands of years. Anonymity can be useful to express opinions without a person’s
        identity itself biasing the people listening for or against the topic. Even in the United States, founding
        fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers to sway the vote in favor of
        ratifying the Constitution, all anonymously published, using a pseudonym.</p>
    <p>However, anonymity can be used for good or for bad. Whistleblowers from tyrannical governments or companies
        conduction illegal business practices need anonymity in order to be able to tell reporters or governments the
        truth. Without it, the repercussions could range from simply losing their jobs to violence inflicted upon them
        and anyone related to them. Anonymity is also greatly helpful for people seeking advice, both mental or
        physical, for situations in which being identified could be embarrassing. Anonymity also helps people express
        themselves and be evaluated for it honestly, without their age, ethnicity, gender, or any other factors
        affecting how they are viewed.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, anonymity could also be used for bad, illegal things as well. It could be something relatively
        smaller, like posting defamatory or even just plain mean things about people, as we might see on a Reddit thread
        or the YouTube comment section. But it often gets a lot worse too. Distribution of child pornography has been a
        blight on the world, and the anonymity that the internet provides has greatly aided its distributors. The ethics
        surrounding the illegalization of narcotics is a separate issue, but the anonymity that the internet provides
        allows people to sell them online, unchecked and untested. Even assassins can be hired on the internet.</p>
    <p>The internet, by itself, is not completely anonymous though. It is not difficult to track a user that is using
        any kind of internet service. That is unless the user takes steps to protect their identity and prevent their
        viewing habits from being tracked. Anonymity networks make use of special overlay relay networks that are
        distributed around the world so that the location of each participant is hidden from the others. The traffic of
        a user is moved through a distributed worldwide set of volunteer relay servers, which effectively makes the
        user’s traffic hidden from any surveillance, or at least makes it very difficult to view.</p>
    <h2>Tor</h2>
    <p>Tor is one such anonymous network, initially developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and further developed
        by DARPA, to protect US intelligence communications. It is popular now because it is open source and free to use
        to the public. It makes use of onion routing, which encapsulates the data in multiple layers of encryption, like
        an onion. At each relay node, a layer is decrypted until the final relay node, at which point the innermost
        layer is decrypted and the actual message is sent to the destination, without revealing where it came from.
        Thus, Tor is extremely popular among those who wish to anonymize their internet traffic. Consequently, it is
        also a target for attacks, since adversaries would want to break through and prevent this anonymity.</p>
    <h2>The Sniper Attack</h2>
    <p>Jansen et al. presented a new denial of service attack against Tor that could selectively and anonymously disable
        Tor relays, published in the Defense Technical Information Center. The reason this attack was a big deal was
        that this attack could be perpetrated at a very low cost to the attacker. The attacker would need very modest
        computational resources to pull this off. The attack worked by remotely crashing a relay by exhaustively
        consuming its memory resources. The paper presented three attacks that used two techniques.
    <ol>
        <li>The attacker stops reading from the TCP connection after requesting the data. As a result, the TCP window on
            the victim's outgoing connection closes, causing the victim to buffer 1000 cells.
        </li>
        <li>The attacker intentionally causes additional cells to be sent to the victim, by requesting more data by
            sending SENDME signals, or by ignoring the package window at the packing end of the circuit
        </li>
    </ol>
    The combination of these two proves deadly to the victim relay.
    The three attacks are as follows:</p>
    <h3>1. Attacking the Entry Relay (Basic Attack)</h3>
    <p>In this attack, the attacker has control of the exit relay aside from the client. To perpetrate this attack, the
        attacker builds a circuit from the client to its own controlled exit relay <em>via</em> the victim entry relay.
        Since the attacker controls the exit relay, they can effectively generate and send as much data as it wants back
        through the circuit, ignoring all the size limits. On the client end, the client can stop reading from the TCP
        connection, forcing the target entry relay to buffer the data, until it runs out of memory and crashes the
        application.</p>
    <h3>2. Attacking the Exit Relay (Basic Attack)</h3>
    <p>This attack works as a reversal of the previous attack. In this one, the attacker has control a destination
        server aside from the client. To perpetrate this attack, the attacker builds a circuit from the client to its
        own controlled destination server <em>via</em> the victim exit relay. The attacker-controlled client can
        effectively generate and send as much data as it wants through the circuit, ignoring all the size limits. On the
        controlled destination server end, it can stop reading from the TCP connection, forcing the target exit relay to
        buffer the data, until it runs out of memory and crashes the application.</p>
    <h3>3. The Efficient Attack</h3>
    <p>While the previous two attacks are effective, they are not very efficient. There are two reasons for this.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Since the attacker has to generate the data themselves, the consumed bandwidth is equal to the amount
            required to crash the victim relay.
        </li>
        <li>The attacker needs control of either an exit relay or a destination server.</li>
    </ul>
    The final proposed attack deals with both of these issues.<br>
    <p>In this attack, the attacker only has control of the client. The circuit is first created with the victim entry
        relay. The client then sends a request via the circuit towards the exit relay to fetch a large file. The exit
        relay
        starts sending the requested data back, at which point the client stops reading from the TCP connection with the
        entry relay. This triggers the relays's buffering mechanism and the relay buffers 1000 cells.<br>
    <p>
        Now, the client has to effectively trick the exit relay into sending more data. It can accomplish this by
        sending a
        SENDME cell to the exit. This SENDME cell is a Tor control cell that tells a relay that the client has consumed
        the
        data and instructs it to send more data. As long as this SENDME cell is sent periodically, the exit relay will
        not
        break the connection and will continue to send the data, eventually overwhelming the victim entry relay's
        capacity.
        The bandwidth cost for the attacker is only the cost of sending the SENDME cells.<br>
    <p>
        The best part is that the attacker can be anonymized themselves by simply using another instance of Tor to run
        the
        attack from, ironically using the same service to protect themselves that they are attacking.

    <h2>Defense against the Sniper Attack</h2>
    <p>The paper discusses a few defenses that can be employed against the Sniper Attack. It must be noted here that the
        authors communicated to the Tor Project all of the details about the attack, and Tor has implemented defenses
        against it since then.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Authenticated SENDMEs: The reason that sending the SENDME cell works to trick the exit relay into sending
            more data is that the exit relay has no way of knowing whether the client actually received the data, and
            accepts the SENDME cell trusting it to be accurate. This defense suggests demanding some sort of proof that
            the data was used before sending any more in a challenge-response mechanism.<br>
            WEAKNESS:
            This method has a weakness, in that it doesn't prevent the initial queuing from taking place, so while if
            the challenge-response fails the circuit is broken, a parallel attack from another client could still
            overflow the victim relay.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Queue Length Limit: This defense works by limiting the size of the data a circuit may consume by limiting
            the queue size. If the queue size grows larger than the allowed size, it is seen as a potential attack and
            the circuit is destroyed.<br>
            WEAKNESS:
            This defense is once again vulnerable to parallel attacks from multiple clients. Further, choosing the right
            queue size is an issue, since we don't want benign circuits to be killed either.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Adaptive Circuit Killing: This defense tries to deal with the possibility of parallel attacks. Here it
            allows relays to kill circuits once the total memory consumed crosses a threshold. The issue arises as to
            how to decide which circuit to kill. One option is to kill the circuit that is consuming the largest queue
            size. The weakness of this is that the attacker could simply launch multiple attacks using low queue sizes,
            and so a benign circuit that happens to have a queue size greater than the attacker's queue size would get
            killed instead. The paper instead suggests picking the circuit to kill based on time of arrival. This
            defense mechanism is simple and easy to implement as well.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>This paper provides a very strong case for the attack working. The Sniper Attack is a well-described, systematic
        approach to disabling the Tor network. It would have been easy for them to have simply described the attack and
        its implications and left it at that. So I liked that they also provided multiple ways to secure against their
        own attack, and also pointed out the weakness in some of those methods as well. I further liked that the authors
        communicated all of their research with the Tor Project and worked with them to develop workarounds that are now
        officially in place.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the defenses, however, I'm not sure I fully agree with the defenses. I do find that even their best
        defense wasn't fully perfect. Killing circuits based on any given metric will cause many false positives to
        occur and would cause benign circuits to be killed. The defense would thus indirectly but effectively actually
        cause a denial of service.</p>
    <h2>Other Papers</h2>
    <p>This was a major paper about an attack developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, so it was understandably
        cited by a large number of future publications.

    </ul>

    <p>Relevant to our topic, a paper titled "Enhancing Security and Privacy of Tor’s Ecosystem by Using Trusted
        Execution Environments" suggested using Trusted Execution Environments like Intel SGX to better protect the
        anonymous network. The authors developed a version of Tor called SGX Tor that incorporated this suggestion. They
        tested their new method to make sure it wouldn't succumb to the Sniper Attack, and now list it among the attacks
        that their SGX Tor implementation can thwart.</p>
