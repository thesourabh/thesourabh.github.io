<h1>Attacking the TOR Network</h1>
<section>
    <p>Anonymity is not a recent concern. The desire to be able to speak or act without fear of repercussions has been
        one that has existed for thousands of years. Anonymity can be useful to express opinions without a person’s
        identity itself biasing the people listening for or against the topic. Even in the United States, founding
        fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers to sway the vote in favor of
        ratifying the Constitution, all anonymously published, using a pseudonym.</p>
    <p>However, anonymity can be used for good or for bad. Whistleblowers from tyrannical governments or companies
        conduction illegal business practices need anonymity in order to be able to tell reporters or governments the
        truth. Without it, the repercussions could range from simply losing their jobs to violence inflicted upon them
        and anyone related to them. Anonymity is also greatly helpful for people seeking advice, both mental or
        physical, for situations in which being identified could be embarrassing. Anonymity also helps people express
        themselves and be evaluated for it honestly, without their age, ethnicity, gender, or any other factors
        affecting how they are viewed.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, anonymity could also be used for bad, illegal things as well. It could be something relatively
        smaller, like posting defamatory or even just plain mean things about people, as we might see on a Reddit thread
        or the YouTube comment section. But it often gets a lot worse too. Distribution of child pornography has been a
        blight on the world, and the anonymity that the internet provides has greatly aided its distributors. The ethics
        surrounding the illegalization of narcotics is a separate issue, but the anonymity that the internet provides
        allows people to sell them online, unchecked and untested. Even assassins can be hired on the internet.</p>
    <p>The internet, by itself, is not completely anonymous though. It is not difficult to track a user that is using
        any kind of internet service. That is unless the user takes steps to protect their identity and prevent their
        viewing habits from being tracked. Anonymity networks make use of special overlay relay networks that are
        distributed around the world so that the location of each participant is hidden from the others. The traffic of
        a user is moved through a distributed worldwide set of volunteer relay servers, which effectively makes the
        user’s traffic hidden from any surveillance, or at least makes it very difficult to view.</p>
    <h2>Tor</h2>
    <p>Tor is one such anonymous network, initially developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and further developed
        by DARPA, to protect US intelligence communications. It is popular now because it is open source and free to use
        to the public. It makes use of onion routing, which encapsulates the data in multiple layers of encryption, like
        an onion. At each relay node, a layer is decrypted until the final relay node, at which point the innermost
        layer is decrypted and the actual message is sent to the destination, without revealing where it came from.
        Thus, Tor is extremely popular among those who wish to anonymize their internet traffic. Consequently, it is
        also a target for attacks, since adversaries would want to break through and prevent this anonymity.</p>
    <h2>The Sniper Attack</h2>
    <p>Jansen et al. presented a new denial of service attack against Tor that could selectively and anonymously disable
        Tor relays, published in the Defense Technical Information Center. The reason this attack was a big deal was
        that this attack could be perpetrated at a very low cost to the attacker. The attacker would need very modest
        computational resources to pull this off. The attack worked by remotely crashing a relay by exhaustively
        consuming its memory resources. The paper presented three attacks that used two techniques.
    <ol>
        <li>The attacker stops reading from the TCP connection after requesting the data. As a result, the TCP window on
            the victim's outgoing connection closes, causing the victim to buffer 1000 cells.
        </li>
        <li>The attacker intentionally causes additional cells to be sent to the victim, by requesting more data by
            sending SENDME signals, or by ignoring the package window at the packing end of the circuit
        </li>
    </ol>
    The combination of these two proves deadly to the victim relay.
    The three attacks are as follows:</p>
    <h3>1. Attacking the Entry Relay (Basic Attack)</h3>
    <p>In this attack, the attacker has control of the exit relay aside from the client. To perpetrate this attack, the
        attacker builds a circuit from the client to its own controlled exit relay <em>via</em> the victim entry relay.
        Since the attacker controls the exit relay, they can effectively generate and send as much data as it wants back
        through the circuit, ignoring all the size limits. On the client end, the client can stop reading from the TCP
        connection, forcing the target entry relay to buffer the data, until it runs out of memory and crashes the
        application.</p>
    <h3>2. Attacking the Exit Relay (Basic Attack)</h3>
    <p>This attack works as a reversal of the previous attack. In this one, the attacker has control a destination
        server aside from the client. To perpetrate this attack, the attacker builds a circuit from the client to its
        own controlled destination server <em>via</em> the victim exit relay. The attacker-controlled client can
        effectively generate and send as much data as it wants through the circuit, ignoring all the size limits. On the
        controlled destination server end, it can stop reading from the TCP connection, forcing the target exit relay to
        buffer the data, until it runs out of memory and crashes the application.</p>
    <h3>3. Efficient Attack</h3>
    <p>While the previous two attacks are effective, they are not very efficient. There are two reasons for this.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Since the attacker has to generate the data themselves, the consumed bandwidth is equal to the amount
            required to crash the victim relay.
        </li>
        <li>The attacker needs control of either an exit relay or a destination server.</li>
    </ul>
    The final proposed attack deals with both of these issues.<br>
    <p>In this attack, the attacker only has control of the client. The circuit is first created with the victim entry
    relay. The client then sends a request via the circuit towards the exit relay to fetch a large file. The exit relay
    starts sending the requested data back, at which point the client stops reading from the TCP connection with the
    entry relay. This triggers the relays's buffering mechanism and the relay buffers 1000 cells.<br>
    <p>
    Now, the client has to effectively trick the exit relay into sending more data. It can accomplish this by sending a
    SENDME cell to the exit. This SENDME cell is a Tor control cell that tells a relay that the client has consumed the
    data and instructs it to send more data. As long as this SENDME cell is sent periodically, the exit relay will not
    break the connection and will continue to send the data, eventually overwhelming the victim entry relay's capacity.
    The bandwidth cost for the attacker is only the cost of sending the SENDME cells.<br>
    <p>
    The best part is that the attacker can be anonymized themselves by simply using another instance of Tor to run the
    attack from, ironically using the same service to protect themselves that they are attacking.
