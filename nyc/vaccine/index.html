Appointments open up throughout the day, but midnight - 3am drops are more frequent. Might help to enter "New York, NY" instead of the zip code. Don't do it faster than once a second or so, or they may lock you out for a day. If this happens, you can still use your phone data instead of wifi. 
By far the most stable booking process. If you book Moderna or Pfizer, they let you book the second time slot at the same time so that you know the date and time up front.

These drop large numbers of appointments at once. After entering your information, once the page with the list of locations and vaccines popup, open 'Schedule your vaccine appointment' in a new tab each time.
For Pfizer at Javits Center, you'll have to open a new tab each time to refresh. For J&J, open in a new tab once, and you can keep refreshing the page.

Once you reach the screen where you enter the date and zip code, keep removing the last character of the zip code and adding it back in order to refresh it. Don't refresh the entire page.
